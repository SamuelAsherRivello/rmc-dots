BACKSTORY
* April 2024 - I had RMC.DOTS depend on RMC.Core. I see that in a new project when I import RMC.DOTS, there is an error caused by RMC.Core (related to DOTween). Not sure, but I think that caused other issues

TODO
* Update RMC.Core and RMC.DOTs to depend on RMC Audio
* Add the content in this folder to the RMC.Core

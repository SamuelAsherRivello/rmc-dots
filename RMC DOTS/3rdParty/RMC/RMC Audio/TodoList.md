BACKSTORY
* April 2024 - I had RMC.DOTS depend on RMC.Core. I see that in a new project when I import RMC.DOTS, there is an error caused by RMC.Core (related to DOTween). Not sure, but I think that caused other issues
* April 2024 - I extracted the RMC.Audio out of RMC.Core and no longer depend on it


TODO
* Move RMC.Audio out of RMC.Core and into its own package.
* Update RMC.Core and RMC.DOTs to depend on RMC Audio
* Done!
